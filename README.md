# Arf

Arf (Android Remote Fudge) is an extension to the default `MifiService.apk`. It enhances the existing 
WebUI by introducing new API endpoints and building upon the original interface. Arf communicates 
with the default APIs using JavaScript within the WebUI, enabling more flexible and feature-rich 
interactions.
